# Investigation-of-Heat-Reduction-in-Re-entry-Vehicle-via-Counterflow-Jet-Mechanism
Explored the efficiency of an opposing jet as an aerodynamic spike through experimental study, effectively displacing detached
shock waves and creating recirculation zones to mitigate nose area aerodynamic heating.
− Drew upon the findings of the study to ascertain a substantial reduction in steady-state surface heat flow, notably at the
blunt body’s nose, affirming the viability.
